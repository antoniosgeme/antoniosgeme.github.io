- project: Aerodynamics of Wing-Gust Encounters
  description : Large force transients produced during atmospheric gust encounters can lead to aircraft structural damage or catastrophic loss of control. This project entails an investigation of the physics of wing-gust encounters as well as the development of load prediction tools for unsteady, post-stall aerodynamics.

- project: Vortex Particle Modeling of Leading-Edge Separation
  description : Combining traditional panel methods with vorticity representations of unsteady flows results in powerful simulations that balance modeling fidelity with computational complexity. This work seeks to extend this class of methods to flows involving boundary-layer separation and leading-edge vortex formation.

- project: Time-Resolved and 3D Particle Velocimetry
  description : When studying unsteady flows we are often interested in the transient rather than the time-averaged behavior of systems. Modern Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques allow us to conduct time-resolved experiments, while recent advances in particle tracking allows us to measure flow motion in 3 dimensions.

- project: Vortex Breakdown
  description : Vortex breakdown is a physical process that lies at the heart of engineered systems such as delta wings and gas turbine combustion chambers. This project seeks to unravel the physics and stability characteristics of vortices undergoing breakdown in the presence of non-isothermal inflows. This work was led by Assaf Krupnik.
