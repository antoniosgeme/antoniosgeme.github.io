Greetings! I am a PhD Candidate pursuing my studies in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland, where I'm fortunate to conduct research under the guidance of [Dr. Anya Jones](https://aero.umd.edu/clark/faculty/40/Anya-R-Jones) in the [Separated and Transient Aerodynamics Laboratory (STAL)](http://stal.umd.edu/). My research revolves around the realms of unsteady aerodynamics and control theory, and is aimed at addressing challenges across fields such as aerospace engineering and renewable energy.
