Greetings! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland, where I'm fortunate to conduct research under the guidance of [Dr. Anya Jones](https://aero.umd.edu/clark/faculty/40/Anya-R-Jones) in the [Separated and Transient Aerodynamics Laboratory (STAL)](http://stal.umd.edu/). My research revolves around the realms of unsteady aerodynamics, control theory, and optimization and is primarly aimed at addressing challenges in the aerospace engineering and renewable energy sectors. 

Previously, I earned a Bachelor's in mechanical engineering from New York University and a Master's in aeronuatical engineering from the University of Cambridge. I have worked on a diverse set of problems, ranging from biomimetic robotics to combustion thermoacoustics. All of them however, have followed a common premise: understanding and manipulating complex fluid behavior and its interaction with engineering systems.
