I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland doing my research under the supervision of [Dr. Anya Jones](https://aero.umd.edu/clark/faculty/40/Anya-R-Jones) in the [Separated and Transient Aerodynamics Laboratory (STAL)](http://stal.umd.edu/)


 I am interested in the flow-physics of flight in unsteady environments as well as the design of physics-informed flight controllers. My current research is focused on understanding the aerodynamics of large-amplitude gust encounters and designing methods to mitigate unsteady aerodynamic forcing.  I work on designing methods to integrate flow sensing information in the control-loop.  Additionally, I work on utilizing classical, unsteady aerodynamics theory to aid in the design of optimal, robust controllers. My goal to understand how to design aircraft that use unsteady lift mechanisms (such as birds) and that can reliably operate in unsteady environments (such as cities)
