Greetings! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland, where I'm fortunate to conduct research under the guidance of [Dr. Anya Jones](https://aero.umd.edu/clark/faculty/40/Anya-R-Jones) in the [Separated and Transient Aerodynamics Laboratory (STAL)](http://stal.umd.edu/). My research revolves around the realms of unsteady aerodynamics, control theory, and optimization and is primarly aimed at addressing challenges in the aerospace engineering and renewable energy sectors. 

Nowadays, you can often find me in the lab doing experiments in a water tank or wind tunnel facility. I enjoy designing and building wing models that allow us to make novel measurements. Previously, I earned a Bachelor's in mechanical engineering from New York University and a Master's in aeronuatical engineering from the University of Cambridge.
