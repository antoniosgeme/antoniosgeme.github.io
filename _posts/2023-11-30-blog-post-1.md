Welcome to my first blog post! I want to use this platform to share some thoughts or technical material that I find useful and I don't think are taught often. I would also like to make it as interactive as possible. Unfortunately, this website is jekyll based and so it is *static*. What this means is that all the code for this website is generated before you click on this page, so interactivity is not really possible in the traditional sense. However, that does not stop us from building the interactivity on another platform and then embedding here. I will be using [observableHQ](https://observablehq.com/) notebooks. They are lots of fun. 


### Preliminaries
In this post we will create a very basic potential flow visualizer. Without getting too bogged down on the mathematical details, a flow is called potential if its velocity field can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential, $ \mathbf{u} = \nabla \phi$. The incompresilbity condition of a fluid, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}= 0$ also implies that the scalar potential satisfies Laplace's equation $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$. The good news is that we know *a lot* about the solutions of Laplace's equations. Its linearity also allows us to construct solutions by taking linear combinations of other solutions. 

### Flow over a cylinder
A set of mathematically important solutions to Laplace's equation are called **fundamental solutions**. Three of them are of interest to us: the uniform flow, the point vortex flow, and the doublet flow. A uniform flow is characterized by its freestream velocity, $U_{\infty}$, and its flow angle, $\alpha$. A point vortex flow is characterized by its circulation, $\Gamma$, and a doublet flow is characterized by its doublet strength, $\kappa$, and (for simplicity) the same flow angle, $\alpha$. The complex velocity induced by each of these flows are, 

$$
\begin{equation}
W_{U} = U_{\infty} e^{-i\alpha} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
W_{V} = \frac{i \Gamma}{2\pi \zeta} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
W_{D} = -\frac{\kappa}{\zeta^2}e^{i\alpha}
\end{equation}
$$

The interactive plot below plots the streamlines - or paths that the fluid takes - as well as the pressure field induced by each of the above flows. The dropdown menu allows you to toggle between the different flows as well as their linear combinations. The coefficients can be adjusted using the sliders below the plot.
