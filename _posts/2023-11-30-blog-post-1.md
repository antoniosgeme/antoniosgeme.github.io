For my first blog post I am going to try to create an interactive potential flow and conformal map calculator. The goal is to gain some visual intuition on how conformal maps work and how they are used in the theory of aerodynamics. There are many great resources out there that do a great job at this. What I am hoping will be an interesting twist to some of you, is the idea of a modified kutta condition in the presence of *flow vorticity*. If you do not know what this means, don't worry, I will try to go through all the basic principles. 

For mathematical convenience we will chose to work in the complex plane. The complex spatial coordinate will be $\zeta = x+iy \in \mathbb{C}$ and the complex velocity will be $W \in = u+iv \mathbb{C}$. In this $\zeta$-plane, there is a circular cylinder with radius $a$ that is centered at the origin. The cylinder is immersed in an *inviscid* flow. Our first job is to find the velocity field , $W$, that represents this flow. That is find $W$ that satisfies the governing equations as well as some boundary condtions. Since we are working with complex numbers, the governing equations of an inviscid flow simplify to $W$ being an *analytic* function of the complex variable $\zeta$. The boundary conditions require that $W$ has a 0 normal component to the surface of a solid body,i.e., the cylinder. The solution of this problem has been known for quite a while and is visualized below,
