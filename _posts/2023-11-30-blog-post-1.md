For my first blog post I am going to try to create a very basic potential flow and conformal map calculator. The goal is to gain some visual intuition on how conformal maps work and how they are used in the theory of aerodynamics. There are many great resources out there that do a great job at this. However, I am going to use this blog as building blog (hehe) for more advanced content. Let us first review some of the mathematical background and basic potential flow principles. 

## Mathematical background
### Potential flows
Finding exact solutions to problems that involve the motion of a fluid (aerodynamics being the example used here) is usually impossible due to the mathematical difficulty posed by the Navier-Stokes equations - the equations that govern fluid motion. They are nonlinear, partial differential equations that look like this:

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} &= 0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} &= -\frac{\nabla P}{\rho} + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}
\end{align}
$$
The task is to find a solution for the velocity vector field, $\mathbf{u}$, that satisfies the above equations, along with some boundary conditions. In aerodynamics, the boundary conditions typically consist of the requirements for the velocity of the fluid to be 0 on every solid boundary, i.e., a wall or an immersed object such as an aircraft flight surface. 

If we ignore the **viscosity** of the fluid, we can often get decent approximations of the velocity field for certain types of problems. The problem of determining the motion of a fluid in this case becomes *linear*, and is governed by Laplace's equation, $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$, a much more reasonable looking equation. $\phi$ is a scalar potential, that relates to the velocity of the fluid through its gradient, $\nabla \phi  = \mathbf{u}$. In addition, the boundary conditions now only require the wall-normal component of velocity to be 0, but not the wall-tangent component. The solutions to Laplace's equations are very well understood and are useful across numerous scientific disciplines. The main advantage is that is it *linear* in velocity. Thus, we can construct solutions to problems we are interested in by taking linear combinations of other known solutions - and that is precisely what we'll do in a second. 

### Complex Potential
While not completely necessary, there is tremendous benefit in working with complex numbers when dealing with potential flows. In two dimensions, that means that we stich the x-component of the vectors to the real part of a complex number and the y-component to the imaginary part, so the complex spatial coordinate becomes $\zeta = x+iy$, the complex velocity becomes $W = u-iv$, and the complex potential becomes $F = \phi+i\psi$. Note that complex potential is related to the complex velocity through its complex derivative $W = \frac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}\zeta}$  

## Flow over a cylinder
A set of mathematically important solutions to Laplace's equation are called **fundamental solutions**. Three of them are of interest to us: the uniform flow, the point vortex flow, and the doublet flow. A uniform flow is characterized by its freestream velocity, $U_{\infty}$, and its flow angle, $\alpha$. A point vortex flow is characterized by its circulation, $\Gamma$, and a doublet flow is characterized by its doublet strength, $\kappa$, and (for simplicity) the same flow angle, $\alpha$. The interactive plot below plots the streamlines - or paths that the fluid takes - as well as the pressure field induced by each of the above flows. The dropdown menu allows you to toggle between the different flows as well as their linear combinations. The complex potential they each induce is

$$
\begin{align}
W_{U} &= U_{\infty} e^{-i\alpha} \\
W_{V} &= \frac{i \Gamma}{2\pi \zeta} \\
W_{D} &= -\frac{\kappa}{\zeta^2}e^{i\alpha}
\end{align}
$$
