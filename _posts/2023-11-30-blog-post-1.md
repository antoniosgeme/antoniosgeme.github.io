For my first blog post I am going to try to create an interactive potential flow and conformal map calculator. The goal is to gain some visual intuition on how conformal maps work and how they are used in the theory of aerodynamics. There are many great resources out there that do a great job at this. What I am hoping will be an interesting twist to some of you, is the idea of a modified kutta condition in the presence of *flow vorticity*. If you do not know what this means, don't worry - I will try to go through all the basic principles. 

For mathematical convenience we will chose to work in the complex plane. The complex spatial coordinate will be $\zeta \in \mathbb{C}$ and the complex velocity will be $W \in \mathbb{C}$. In this $\zeta$-plane, there is a circular cylinder with radius $a$ that is centered at the origin. The cylinder is immersed in an *inviscid* flow 

Our starting point is the solution to the potential flow around a circular cylinder. In the theory of inviscid fluids, the velocity field can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential $\vec{u} = \nabla \phi$, where $\vec{u}$ is the velocity vector field and $\phi$ is a scalar potential which must satisfy $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$, i.e. Laplace's equation. For the flow over a circular cylinder (or any other body really), the potential must satisfy the additional condition of inducing no flow through the surface of the body. Mathematically, this can be stated as $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n}$ = 0, where $n$  is the surface normal vector on the surface of the body. 

The solution to this problem is well-known and can be constructed by superposition of a uniform flow, a doublet, and a vortex, which are fundamental solutions of Laplace's equation above.
